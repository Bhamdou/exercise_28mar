In this exercise, I will create a simple Python script to implement a RESTful API using Flask. This exercise will give exposure to backend web development using Python, which is a valuable skill in the job market, particularly for web developers and full-stack developers.

First, need to install the necessary library using pip:

pip install Flask
 




Run the script to start the Flask development server.

This exercise introduces to the following concepts:

Creating a RESTful API using Flask
Handling HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Working with JSON data
Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
These skills are essential for web developers and full-stack developers, as they allow you to create, maintain, and interact with backend services that manage data and business logic for web applications.
